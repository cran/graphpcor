Description: Implement some models for 
  correlation/covariance matrices including two approaches 
  to model correlation matrices from a graphical structure.
  One use latent parent variables as proposed in
  Sterrantino et. al. (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.06289>.
  The other uses a graph to specify conditional 
  relations between the variables.
  The graphical structure makes correlation matrices 
  interpretable and avoids the quadratic increase of 
  parameters as a function of the dimension. 
  In the first approach a natural sequence of simpler 
  models along with a complexity penalization is used.
  The second penalizes deviations from a base model.
  These can be used as prior for model parameters,
  considering C code through the 'cgeneric' interface 
  for the 'INLA' package (<https://www.r-inla.org>). 
  This allows one to use these models as building 
  blocks combined and to other latent Gaussian models 
  in order to build complex data models.
